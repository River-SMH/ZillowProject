# ZILLOW DATA PROJECT
* This project's goal was to extract property info from zillow's website, store the information gathered, and place it into an interactive map that displays the information. 
* Project uses Folium, Pandas, geopy, and requests mainly.
* The project did get blocked by Zillow after an attempt was made. It was blocked due to many requests being made within a short time.
* Project makes a request to Zillow and reads in what was sent back and attempts to scrape all releveant information for the project (Address, Price, Sqft, Img, etc).
* Zillow has changed their html structure so the webscraper no longer works after April 2024. 
* Project includes a test case of what would have been collected when not blocked and was used during April 2024.
* Project uses PostgreSQL for the database.
* Project outputs a html file.
* Project was for Python Directed Studies under NMU.
